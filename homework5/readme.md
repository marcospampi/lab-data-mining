### Notes
We have been required to follow an object-oriented approach, my work doesn't stricly follow this requirements as a jupyter notebook is provided.

I did my best not to put any verbose or annoying code in this notebook.

### Prerequisites
Install requirements fro requirements.txt
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create `.env` file:
```
TASK_DATASET_FILE_PATH = <path_to_your_dataset_file>
```
