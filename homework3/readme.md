# Homework 3
This homework has been assigned in date 8th of November 2024.
We have been required to complete a series of tasks on a *basket-item* kind dataset:
1. Apply the **fp-growth** algorithm to to detaset, present the most intersting results. 
2. Make a comparison between **apriori** and **fp-growth**.

We have been offered a dataset of transactions owned by a third party, as I have no rights over it, I assume we are not allowed to share, please reach out our professors of *Introduction to Data Mining* at [this link](https://web.dmi.unict.it/courses/l-31/course-units/?seuid=8EAB2D3A-4281-40F4-83A0-C6B007577BA2) if interested.

### Notes
We have been required to follow an object-oriented approach, my work doesn't stricly follow this requirements as a jupyter notebook is provided.

I did my best not to put any verbose or annoying code in this notebook.

### Prerequisites

pip install -r requirements.txt
